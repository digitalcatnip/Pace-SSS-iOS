# Pace Special Support Services iOS App
This is the codebase for the Pace University Special Support Services iOS app.
Any significant notes that need to be recorded should go in this file for future reference.

# Synx
We use [Synx](https://github.com/venmo/synx) to keep the project folders
organized.  Make sure you commit any changes before running synx to be able
to revert any weird refactoring.

# Cocoapods
[Cocoapods](https://cocoapods.org/) is the largest dependency manager for iOS -
similar to gradle's use on Android.  Make sure you install the command line tools
for Cocoapods prior to opening the project.  To open the project in XCode, you
will need to use the .xcworkspace file after you run `pod update` on the command line.
